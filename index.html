        <h2>Some of the band's ratings from the fans...</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>★★★★★

                Oasis is probably one of the most underrated bands in the history of music. Well outside of UK atleast, because they got their fair share of recognition within the UK...</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>★★★★★

                        The key to becoming fan of a band is not only enjoying their music but also understanding it . And one must understand the band at different levels...</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>★★★

                        It's the Kind of genre that they had produced is impeccably flawless...</p>
                </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>So it seems as a really good band right? Well, continue reading...</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Don't look back in anger</li>
            <li>Wonderwall</li>
            <li>Live forever</li>

        </ol>

        <h4>Some aclarations...</h4>
        <p>I must say that wonderwall and Married w/children weren't on that position on the top, but also (and I hope someone agrees with me) I couldn't stand how the hell wonderwall was so down, and so I put it in the right place.

        <h2>Now let's rate albums...</h2>
        <h3>First some reviews from community:</h3>
        <ul>
            
           
            <li><u>The Masterplan</u>: Yes, yes, we know, The Masterplan is not an Oasis studio album, and usually B-sides and rarities collections would not be included for consideration on a list such as this.</li>
             <li><u>(What's the story) Morning Glory</u>: To be fair, pretty much every track sounds like a single, and deeper cuts like Hello and Cast No Shadow are just as good as Don’t Look Back in Anger or Some Might Say...</li>
            
            <li><u>Don't Believe the Truth</u>: The best album by the non-classic line up of Oasis by some distance. Don’t Believe the Truth is the closest Noel and Liam ever came to putting out a record that gets close to the consistency of their earliest material.</li>
            <li> <u>Definetly Maybe</u>: Definitely Maybe is a timeless, ageless classic album, comprised solely of huge rock and roll tunes, Godzilla-sized choruses and lyrics that make you feel like you’re the centre of the fucking universe.</li>
            <li><u>Standing on the Shoulder of Giants</u>: The lowest point of Oasis’ career by some distance, Standing on the Shoulder of Giants is a mightily bizarre album for a number of reasons...</li>
            <li><u>Heathen Chemistry</u>: Heathen Chemistry scores high for a including a set of hugely anthemic singles; Little by Little, Songbird and the excellent Stop Crying Your Heart Out might all be a bit schmaltzy...</li>
            <li><u>Dig Out Your Soul</u>: The final Oasis album, released only 10 months before an infamous backstage altercation between Noel and Liam in Paris that led to the split of the band, is a rather sad way for the band to go out...</li>
            <li><u>Be Here Now</u>: Notorious for its length, its pomposity, its excess and its expense, Be Here Now has become the classic cautionary tale for any band who hit it big to keep their feet on the ground.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3>This is how all of them are ranked:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Definetly Maybe</li>
            <li>(What's the story) Morning Glory</li>
            <li>The Masterplan</li>
            <li>Be Here Now</li>
            <li>Don't Believe the Truth</li>
            <li>Heathen Chemistry</li>
            <li>Dig Out Your Soul</li>
            <li>Standing on the Shoulder of Giants</li>
